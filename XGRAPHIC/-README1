                        =========================
                               rev. 1

  This archive is the start of an "Extended Graphics Project", 9640 FORTRAN
  callable routines which perform extensions to the low level graphics
  routines already included in the 9640 GL Library.

  The first routine was uploaded previously, and was a translation of 
  J. Syzdek's circle routine to be callable to 9640 FORTRAN.

  The next two routines are included in this module, and were requested
  by Matt Beebe (who is working on some windowing routines for 9640 
  FORTRAN).  The routines save and restore pixel data to the screen.
  The routines use the 9938 Logical Move commands.

  I'm still not totally happy with the speed of these routines.  Some
  experiments I have done show that just reading the data and ignoring
  the status of the 9938 chip runs about twice as fast as these routines,
  it appears the 9640 is slower than the 9938 chip.   I'm concerned about
  releasing a "fast" version that ignores the 9938 status, however, because
  someone elses GENEVE with say 32k of 0 wait state memory might outrun the
  9938 chip.

  So now, I'll live with the slower version.   I'm open for suggestions
  on how to speed this up, I am sure it will not be fast enough for Matt's
  application.   One thought Paul Charlton had was to use direct VDP 
  memory access (VMBR, VMBW) instead of the 9938 calls.  The only trick
  in doing that is it would have to be done line by line (if the window
  is 100 pixels deep, then 100 seperate VMBR's or VMBW's would have to
  be used).

  Meanwhile, the search for the "ultimate" graphics routines goes on.
  Anyone interested in contributing to the project?   I am mainly being
  driven by user wishes at the moment, these routines are collecting
  as a matter of what code is already available, and what code is really
  needed now by users.

  If you wish to make contributions to the 9640 FORTRAN Extended Graphics
  Project, please contact me and I'll try to keep things in an orderly
  fashion, the routines documented and tested, and as part of a new library
  distributed in the Public Domain.

  I'm not an expert in this graphics area, I hope that users can contribute
  as much as possible to enhancing the graphics area on the 9640 GENEVE
  computer, the 9938 chip has many, many possibilities.
