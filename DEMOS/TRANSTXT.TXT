  Berry Miller asked me to do a little (useful) program to demonstrate
  some of the capabilities of 9640 FORTRAN.   He wanted the program to
  show how strings might be used, and suggested a utility to convert
  DISPLAY/FIXED/128 files to DISPLAY/VARIABLE/80 files.

  Such a program would be a really handy utility for MDOS.  The reason
  The reason hinges behind how the standard TI-99 terminal emulators
  like FASTERM and TELCO handle TEXT or ASCII files (called DISPLAY/
  VARIABLE/80 files on the TI-99 and GENEVE).

  Normal TI-99 and MDOS files get posted on a bulletin board or network
  with a 128 byte header in front of the file, called a "TIFILES" header.
  However, files posted by other computers and ASCII or TEXT files uploaded
  by the TI-99 and MDOS emulators don't have a TIFILES header.

  This causes the dilemma that the terminal emulator doesn't know what
  format the file is supposed to be in.   For example, is it a PROGRAM
  file?  A display/var/80 file?  A display/fix/80 file?

  Most terminal emulators resolve this by creating an arbitrary display/
  fixed/128 file.   Several utilities have arisen which use this format
  (such as the GIF picture utility by Paul Charlton) and this is ok.
  If you are downloading text files, however, this is the wrong format
  and you will see some strange things when you type out the file.

  TRANSFORM fixes this.  It takes a DISPLAY/FIX/128 file (the way it comes
  from the terminal emulator) and creates either a DISPLAY/VAR/80 file
  (for text files) or a DISPLAY/FIX/80 file.

  The GENEVE solution - TRANSFORM
  ===============================

  Included in this archive is a program written in 9640 FORTRAN which
  transforms d/f/128 files into d/f/80 or d/v/80 files.  It is a short
  and simple program which in MDOS tradition, takes it's command parameters
  from the command line (rather then menu driven, like on the TI-99).

  Transform is called from the MDOS command line, with the following
  parameters:

              TRANSFORM [input_file] [output_file][/file]

       input_file  :  name of input file to translate
       output_file :  name of output file to translate
       /option     :  /DF80 for dis/fix/80, /DV80 for dis/var/80
                      (default = dis/fix/80)

  An example of running this program would be:

              TRANSFORM E:CAPTURE128 F:CAPTURE80 /V

  which says to read the d/f/128 input file on the ram disk called
  "capture128", and create a d/v/80 file on the hard disk called
  "capture80".

  Basic Program Structure
  =======================

  The following is a high level "program design language" flow of the
  TRANSFORM program:

        get command line (cmdstr)
        get first file name from command line (getfile)
        get second file name from command line (getfile)
        get option from command line (getfile)
        if no option specified
            set type display/var/80
        else if option is "fixed"
            set type display/fix/80
        else if option is "variable"
            set type display/var/80
        endif
        open input and output files
        do until (end of input data)
          read five display/fixed/128 records from input file
          if ( display/fixed/80 format )
            write eight display/fixed/80 records
          else
            do for each byte in input record
              if ( input byte is cntrl/z )
                set file end
              else if ( input byte is a line feed or overflow d/v/80 record )
                write d/v/80 record
              else if ( input byte is a carriage return )
                ignore input byte
              else if ( input byte is a tab stop )
                detab output record
              else
                move character to output record
              endif
            enddo
          endif
        enddo

  The first thing we do is get the command line string using the CMDSTR
  routine (BTW - Paul Charlton originated this routine, without it almost
  none of the FORTRAN programs would be command line driven).  The program
  then gets three command line arguments using the GETFILE routine:

               1. the input file name (the display/fix/128 file)
               2. the output file name (the display/var/80 file)
               3. the variable or fixed option

   
  It then sets the type flag based on the /F or /V option.

  Conversion of DISPLAY/FIXED/80 files is easy, just read five display/
  fixed/128 records, and write eight display/fixed/80 records.  I picked
  five input records cause it rounded nicely to eight output records.  It
  is usually good on disk I/O programs also to read a good chunk of data
  from one file, and then write a good chunk of data to another file.
  This usually results in faster programs.

  Conversion of DISPLAY/VARIABLE/80 files is a little tougher.  Five
  input records are again read, and then output records are created
  by blanking an output record, reading bytes until a line feed is
  detected, and writing the record to the output file.   If a
  control/z is detected, then an end of file condition is detected and
  the processing terminates.

  I also noted that many of the ASCII files I download are full of
  tab stops.   Many machines (e.g. VAX computers and others) use
  tab stops liberally.   Since the TI-99 and GENEVE can't handle them,
  I strip them out here and "detab" the output file.  This saves you
  a detab step.

  Extending the Utility
  =====================

  I usually offer to the public ways in which the utility could be
  extended or modified.   How about:

    1. A display of which line number the program is currently
       processing.

    2. Conversion of more file types (e.g. d/f/128 to program file,
       etc.)

    3. Variations on both input and output file types.

  If you extend the program, please let me know!   Note, however, the

  want you to change it or use it, but if you do change it, let others
  enjoy what you've done!   Let me know or post it somewhere so we all
  can benefit.
