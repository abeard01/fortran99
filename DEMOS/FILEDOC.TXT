          FileZap - A file sector inspect/editor utility for MDOS
          =======================================================

                     Copyright 1989 by LGMA Products
                     Version 1.6  12-November-1989

  This archive contains a utility program which runs under MDOS.  The utility
  allows you to inspect or alter any MDOS disk file, including files on
  the RAM disk.   Version 1.3 of this program includes provisions to examine
  and alter entire disks.  MDOS 1.14 precludes operation with a hard disk
  file, MDOS .96H or greater corrects this.   MDOS Version 1.4 corrected
  some difficulties with the sound (good and bad beeps), and version 1.5
  was modified to request the file name if not specified on the command
  line (this feature added by request).   Version 1.6 added rudimentery
  search capability, you can search for a word (e.g. 89AB) by using the
  "/" and "N" options.

  The following files are contained in this archive:

             FILEDOC          -   This file
             FILEZAP, FILEZAQ -   The MDOS executable program

   Operation is easy, just put the FILEZAP and FILEZAQ files on your utility
   disk, and type in the command:

             FILEZAP <file to inspect/alter>

   For example, if you put the modules FILEZAP and FILEZAQ on the disk in drive
   A:, and you wanted to inspect/alter a file on drive B: called TEST, you could
   type:

             A:FILEZAP B:TEST
                  or
             DSK1.FILEZAP DSK2.TEST

   You can specify and entire disk to access by specifying the disk drive
   letter followed by a colon (:) or the disk drive name followed by a
   period (.).  For example:

             FILEZAP B:            to examine/alter B drive
             FILEZAP DSK5.         to examine/alter ram disk

   Operation from this point is via single letter commands, as displayed on
   the screen (e.g. press F for page forward).

   The style of this sector editor is patterned after the FileZap utility
   written for the Amiga, copyright 1986 by John Hodgson.

   Version 1.2 of FileZap provided mouse operation, disk sector caching
   for improved response times, and some cosmetic changes.

   Version 1.3 of FileZap provided full disk edit capability, and furthur
   improved disk sector caching.

   Version 1.4 of FileZap fixed some minor formatting mistakes when displaying
   errors.  Fixed CALL SOUND for corrected duration in SOUND routine.

   Version 1.5 of FileZap changed program so the file name is requested if
   not specified by the user.

   Version 1.6 of FileZap added a new search feature (search by word only).

   To use the mouse in FileZap, make sure you have your mouse "plugged-in",
   and you can use the three buttons for the following single letter
   commands:

            right button     :   page forward
            left button      :   page backward
            middle button    :   enter hex modify

   Once in hex or ascii modify mode, the mouse can be used to position the
   cursor to the desired location to modify.  Pressing the middle button
   while in modify mode is the same as <escape>, it causes an exit from
   modify mode.

   distribution.  It is intended as an example of 9640 FORTRAN.   You

   Version 1.3 was born out of a suggestion by Paul Charlton during an
   impromptu conference on Delphi.  Thanks for the suggestion, Paul!

   P.S.  I have been somewhat astounded by the hit this program has made,
   it has already generated many letters, and seems to be on the all
   time hit parade for number of downloads from Delphi.

   I am glad to see such an unexpected response to this utility, after
   all it was just a three day programming effort in 9640 FORTRAN.  But
   I will keep in mind furthur improvements if you provide me with
   suggestions.

   Just for the record, if you have any suggestions or comments concerning
   this program, 99 FORTRAN, or 9640 FORTRAN, you can get in touch with
   me via e-mail on one of the following networks:
