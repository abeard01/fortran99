			   Sine Wave Driver
                            14-October-1988

This is a little demonstration program which shows off the GENEVE bit-
map mode, and the capabilities of the MDOS implementation of 99 FORTRAN.
It draws a sine wave on the screen, complete with X and Y axis, and a
title.

The original program came from Elmer Clausen, who developed a plotting
subroutine for 99 FORTRAN which ran under normal GPL.  This routine
uses the same driver, but calls some of the MDOS video graphic functions,
SETPIX and SETVEC to set pixel colors and set vectors.

The archive contains the following files:

          DRIDOC    :    This File
          DRIVER    :    The 99 FORTRAN Program
          DR,DS     :    The executable program

To run the program, type in the following at the MDOS prompt:

          DR

Two modules will be loaded, DR and DS, and the program will execute
automatically.

I recommend for this program that you have at least MDOS version 1.08
(subsequent or previous versions may require changes to this program).
