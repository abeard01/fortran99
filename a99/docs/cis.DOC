AL: thanks a million! PLEASE keep me posted on the development of the cross
assembler for the 9900/9995, or if I can help in any way. There are some cheap
cross assemblers for the Z80, and others on MSDOS...check the classifieds in
the back of Computer Shopper under MSDOS software. Only $35 for 1st copy, $20
for next, etc. Need both for some quick and dirty assembly at work for an
EEPROM programmer. Also believe the 99 cross assembler has $$$ potential, if
you can get anybody in the TI world to pay you for your sweat nowadays. I am
serious about helping if needed. Don't program in 'C', but do a good job of
technical writing. Keep in touch. Tony.

OK.  Program was taken (assembler part) from an assembler by a University
professor.  I use it extensively, along with the crossloader, to create MDOS
compatible transient commands (& GPL objects).  Ron Lepine's still sweating
with the cross-loader, something about Lattice's PRINTF function works fine on
an Amiga, but chokes on his TIPRO (chuckle).  Let you know when ready.
