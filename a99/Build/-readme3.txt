To whom it may concern:

  This archive contains the executables and documentation for the a99
  cross assembler and companion cross-loader.   The a99 cross assembler
  assembles ti-99/4a source and creates ti-99/4a compatible object.
  The cross-loader links together the modules and allows you to create
  direct e/a 5 executables.

  code that supports the 99000 series processor.
