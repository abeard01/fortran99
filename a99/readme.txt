To whom it may concern -

a99 (and the MDOS version TASM) is an assembler for the TMS9900 microprocessor
used for the TI-99 and MYARC GENEVE 9640 computers.   The code was based on
code posted on Byte Information Exchange (BIX) where I was a co-moderator by
Dr. Bruce Wampler of the University of New Mexico.  The assembler was extended
and a cross loader written that would generate executables.

The code base was lost for some years and I had located two original floppies
from my Amiga computer in the 1980's.   Alan W. Rateliff, II of AtariAge (OLD CS1)
was kind enough to salvage these floppies for me and send me an archive.   I can't
thank Alan enough for his kind efforts.

Included in this archive is the a99 assembler and the cross loader (called loader).

Enjoy
