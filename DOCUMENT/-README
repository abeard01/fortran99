Release Notes : QDE v1.8 for MDOS 1.14        89/01/07

QDE v1.8 was developed using MOS 1.14 and may not run correctly with earlier
versions of MDOS.

QDE v1.8 has the following bug fixes and new features :

 - The inital blank screen which persisted until certain keys (ie. F5) were
   pressed does not occur providing QDE was invoked in 80 column mode.

 - The wipe (^W) command now clears the filename as well as the text buffer,
   eliminating the accidental overwriting of files.

 - The status display (F5) will now show a filename of NULL if a name was
   not entered with the QDE command or the wipe command was issued.

 - The editing screen now displays 26 rows.

 - Standard assembler tab stops may be selected instead of the 4 column stops
   by use of ^9.

 - A show directory (^F) command is available providing the the file SD,
   included in this release, is present on the default device. If RAMdisk
   is the default, task loading is almost instantaneous.

 - The directory display produced by SD has been corrected for files without
   dates and/or spurious attribute bits.

For best results, my MDOS sofware should be run in standalome mode without
a TIMODE statement in the AUTOEXEC file on 512K systems. If you prefer a
dual mode system, configure a 110K ramdisk (100K if the c99 compiler is to
be run) in your AUTOEXEC file. You may use the MDOS command CHKDSK to
determine if sufficient free memory is available.

In summary, to ensure correct operation of QDE v1.8:

 - Run from MDOS 1.14,
 - Be sure that at least 10 pages of free memory are available,
 - Invoke QDE in 80 column mode.
 - Have a copy of the file SD on the default device (preferably RAMdisk)
