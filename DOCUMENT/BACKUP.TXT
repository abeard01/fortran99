                             Introduction
                             ============

Worried about all of those files accumulating on that hard disk?  Yes,
hard disk crashes can happen, I lost a 40mb about 6 months ago, fortunately
I had it backed up and was able to restore 99% of the files.

Since crashes do happen, it is useful to back them up floppies occassionally.
I do a lot of work on the GENEVE, so I like to back mine up about every two
weeks.  Unfortunetely, there hasn't been a real useful backup utility for
the GENEVE (until now).

BACKUP solves this problem.  It allows you to "mass dump" your hard drive
to floppy diskettes, and later restore those files from floppy to the
hard disk (either selectively or all).   All you need to get started is
a bunch of blank unformatted floppy disks and a few hours that you won't
be needing your machine.



                       Backing up your Hard Drive
                       ==========================

BACKUP is called via the simple MDOS command:

       BACKUP [function] [/Hharddrive] [/Ffloppydrive] [/Llisting]

The [function] qualifier must be the first, and specifies what function
you want to perform:


        SAVE      :   Save files from hard disk to floppy disk
        RESTORE   :   Restore files from floppy disk to hard disk
        LIST      :   Generate a listing of a floppy based archive

Of course, the command line has a few qualifiers.  You must specify what
hard drive or hard drive directory(s) you are backing up, and which floppy
drive you will be using for the backup operation.  For example, to back
up drive HDS1. to floppy DSK1. you would specify:

           BACKUP SAVE /HHDS1 /FDSK1

Note that the /H qualifier tells which hard drive or hard drive directory
to use.  Suppose you had a hard drive directory tree which goes something
like this:

           FORTCOMP
              GPL
              MDOS
           COMMANDS
           DSK1
           DSK
             FORTCOMP
               FORT44
               FORT45
               FORT46
             MYWORD

(etc.).  You could backup all of these directories by using the command:

           BACKUP SAVE /HHDS1 /FDSK1

You could back up all of the files and directories under "HDS1.FORTCOMP"
by specifying:

           BACKUP SAVE /HHDS1.FORTCOMP /FDSK1

Simple, eh?

Let's take the command:

           BACKUP SAVE /HHDS1 /FDSK1

again.  Once the command is entered into MDOS, It will start processing
the first file on the drive 'HDS1' (usually your AUTOEXEC file) and will
display the line:

 HDS1.AUTOEXEC                        DIS/VAR   80, SIZE     5
 Would you like me to format a floppy disk in DSK1 (Y/N/Q)?

Insert your first floppy disk into drive DSK2 and press 'Y', and ENTER.
The floppy will be formatted and the backup operation will commence.

Files are written to the floppy using a simple repeat compression algorithm.
The percent reduction in each file size is shown after each file is backed
up (the reduction is most noticable on short, DIS/VAR files.  It is rather
dismal on object files and program files).

The backup will continue on the floppy until the floppy disk is full.  You
are then prompted to insert another diskette, and following a successful
FORMAT, the backup will continue.

Think of the backup as a single long file on multiple floppy diskettes.  Each
floppy is packed to the gills with information about the backup, so the normal
TI format for files is not used;  the archive is actually a display/fixed/128
file which contains many other files in a compressed format.

Each floppy has a single file name in the following format:

                BMMDDYY-NN

where:

                B - Means this is a backup file
               MM - Is the month of backup
               DD - Is the year of backup
               YY - Is the year of backup
               NN - Is the backup disk number (01 to 99)




                            Listing the Backup
                            ==================

Since the files contained within the backup archive cannot be listed using
normal MDOS tools (ok, you might do it with FILEZAP, but it takes a pretty
good hacker at best), BACKUP contains a LIST facility.  The LIST facility
works as follows:

                 BACKUP LIST /HHDS1 /FDSK1

Backup will LIST files located on the /F floppy drive (in this case DSK1)
which start with the name of the /H hard drive (in this case HDS1).

You may list any single floppy or multiple floppies within a backup set
(e.g. you could grab the tenth floppy dumped as part of the backup operation,
shove it in the disk drive, and get a dump of it).





                              Restoring Files
                              ===============

The last operation you might want to do is restore those backed up files
from the floppy disks to the hard disk; this can be done either selectively
or en-mass (just reformatted your hard disk and now you want to restore it?).

Restoring files is easily accomplished using the command:

                     BACKUP RESTORE /HHDS1 /FDSK1

This command will RESTORE files from the floppy disk DSK1 to the hard drive
HDS1.   If you also wanted a log to your printer, you could specify:

                     BACKUP RESTORE /HHDS1 /FDSK1 /LPRN:

and a listing of files restored would be listed on the printer device PRN:.
(usually your parallel based printer).

Before a file is restored, it is checked against the name specified on the
/H option.  For example, if you just wanted to restore files in the directory:

                       HDS1.IMLOST.ADIR

You could specify:

                      BACKUP RESTORE /HHDS1.IMLOST.ADIR /FDSK1

and all files not starting with that name would be skipped.

Also, the restore processor checks to see if the file you are restoring
already exists on the hard disk.  If it does, you will see the message:

                File Already Exists, Shall I Overwrite (Y/N/Q)?

If you want the file to be overwritten, specify a "Y" and return.  If not,
specify a "N" (for skip this file) or "Q" to quit restore.

The restore will operate across multiple floppies (again, think of the archive
as extending across a series of floppy disks).  You will be prompted to mount
the next archive disk.

          !!! IMPORTANT !!! Be sure to mount these disks in sequence!



                          Hints on Using Backup
                          =====================

  1.  Create a log file with your backup, for example:

                 BACKUP SAVE /LHDS1.B010190LO /HHDS1 /FDSK1

      would create a backup log file on HDS1 called B010190LO.
      You can print this later and keep it with your backup disks.

  2.  There currently isn't any support for ds/dd drives, or quad
      density drives.   I'll add some more after MYARC adds floppy
      support for HFDC.

  3.  BACKUP won't stand floppies that won't format properly.  Use
      good quality floppy diskettes for your backup operation (shouldn't
      you be using them anyway)?
