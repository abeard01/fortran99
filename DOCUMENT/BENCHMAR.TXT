The following is a series of benchmark tests and their results for comparing the
various forms of Extended BASIC and the Geneve.
 
Explanation of Benchmarks:
=========== == ==========
 
All benchmarks were performed with the following basic equipment - 1 DS/DD 6MS
Tandon floppy disk drive and a Myarc DS/DD floppy disk controller.  



In Benchmark #1, the test was to see how long it took to draw 100 lines with
random start and stop points. The following is the program used:



       100 CALL KEY(0,K,S) :: IF S=0 THEN 100 ELSE IF K<>89 THEN 100

       110 FOR I=1 TO 100

       120 X1=INT(RND*192)+1

       130 Y1=INT(RND*256)+1
       140 X2=INT(RND*192)+1

       150 Y2=INT(RND*256)+1

       160 CALL DRAW(1,X1,Y1,X2,Y2)

       170 NEXT I



In Benchmark #2 the test was to compute and print 360 SIN calculations, of the
numbers between 1 and 360. This test was performed, whenever possible, in the
four graphic modes supported by Myarc XBII on the Geneve. The code is as
follows:

       

       100 CALL KEY(0,K,S) :: IF S=0 THEN 100 ELSE IF K<>89 THEN 100

       110 FOR I=1 TO 360

       120 Z=SIN(I)

       130 PRINT I;Z

       140 NEXT I



Benchmark #3 is a test of how fast the basics and the computers count from 1 to
2000, and can display each number as they count in the upper left corner. This
test was also performed in all graphics modes possible for the language and
computer.



       100 CALL KEY(0,K,S) :: IF S=0 THEN 100 ELSE IF K<>89 THEN 100

       110 FOR I=1 TO 2000

       120 DISPLAY AT(1,1):I

       130 NEXT I



Benchmark #4 tests how long it takes to write 100, 80 character sequential
records to disk. This test was performed in the Pattern Mode (alternately
GRAPHICS 1 in Myarc XB and the only graphics mode in TI XB):



       100 CALL KEY(0,K,S) :: IF S=0 THEN 100 ELSE IF K<>89 THEN 100

       110 A$=RPT$("X",80) 

       120 OPEN #1:"DSK1.OUT",DISPLAY,VARIABLE 80,OUTPUT

       130 FOR I=1 TO 100 :: PRINT #1:A$ :: NEXT I

       140 CLOSE #1



The last Benchmark, #5, tests how long it takes to read in the 100, 80
character sequential records created in Benchmark #4. Again, this was run
in Pattern mode:



       100 CALL KEY(0,K,S) :: IF S=0 THEN 100 ELSE IF K<>89 THEN 100

       110 OPEN #1:"DSK1.OUT",DISPLAY,VARIABLE 80,INPUT

       120 FOR I=1 TO 100 :: INPUT #1:A$ :: NEXT I

       130 CLOSE #1

*   Garbage was displayed on screen
**  Nothing was displayed - test couldn't be done
*** Every time a disk write was tried, from anywhere, in 99/4A mode of Geneve
    the machine locks up either during or after. Running SLOWVDP does not help.
 
Final Note: All of these times will improve dramatically when the new version
of Extended BASIC (Advanced Extended BASIC) is available for the Geneve. That
Geneve-specific language will feature at least a two-fold increase in most
things, so the total speed improvement in BASIC will be around 6-fold. Other
langauges will also show remarkable improvements, specifically those written
excusively for the Geneve.
