Al,
   Version 1.1 seems to go both ways in squeeze mode.  I was able to restore
the source code with it.  Also successfully squeezed and restored all 775
sectors of FUNLWRITER v4 (saved 110 sectors).  The LIST command still shows
some file header data from a Traver archive shifted 2 bytes to the left (2
leftmost chars dropped and other data read as gibberish).
   LISTing a "STORED" SARC file from the standard archiver shows the opposite
shift (2 leading "blanks" or unprintable chars preceeding the filename) in the
files that fail to restore.  This is generating the I/O errors that prevent
restoration.  I think I'll look at the header sections of STOREd and ARCHIVEd
versions of Funl and make some notes on the differences.  I think the header
glitch may be the only impediment to compatibility, but then I still don't know
exactly what I'm seeing.
   Later, Jerry
 ---- THE ABOVE PREPARED OFF-LINE -- I guess its almost there if you can find
why the byte shift in some (not all) file header data. I get version 3 from
Jeff tomorrow (he forgot it today).
