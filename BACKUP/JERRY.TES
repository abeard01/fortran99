     RE: 4A ASSEMBLY PROGRAMMING (Re: Msg 13770)
     From: JSYZDEK      To: ABEARD (NR)

Al,
  The Editor/Assembler manual shows CIF to be a XMLLNK routine. It also says the

routine is loaded into memory by the E/A loader, so it is not available when XB
is being used.

 I read the section on XMLLNK again and the >0020 address passed to XMLLNK gets
modified by the routine (points to a location in the XB cart?).

 Anyway, I passed this along to the person who asked and will be waiting for his

reply. I would be interested in your CIF routine if you are willing to share it.

 Thanks,    Joe

     RE: TI Pro CD/TI card (Re: Msg 13711)
     From: ENCAMERON    To: FROBOTZ (NR)

   The last time I saw the CSTI board advertised, it was in the SenTInel.  TIPC
Network had it listed for $395 in the November 89 issue.  Be advised, though, it

is only listed as gaining a 98% compatibility, not "totally."  The TIPC Network
folks listed their number in November as 605 356-2910.  The ad was not seen
after the November issue.  So, Good Luck!     Ed Cameron

     RE: 4A ASSEMBLY PROGRAMMING (Re: Msg 13769)
     From: JEAN_MARLEAU To: JSYZDEK

The way to acces this routine in xb is:

  LIMI 0
  CLR  R0
  MOVB R0,@>837C
  BLWP @>2018    XMLLNK
  DATA >20
  LIMI 2

I mean this is a way... The data >0020 in fact is modified in the BLWP in exten
ded basic. Xbasic doesn't access the XML LNK in the same way than E/A. This is
no t shown in the E/A manual. This routine works very well, without problem. I
know
 as I'm used it a lot in the conception of Multi-Mode XB (100% compatible text m

ode and multicolor mode with extended ba sic cartdrige...)

I hope this information can help you,
  Jean

Unless you specifically got 80 track drives they probably are not.  One good
test: If anyone with 40 track drives can read your disks then your drives are 40

track.  I would guess that is your problem -- your drives are only capable of 40

tracks per side.

 Jean,
    Thanks for the info. It is almost identical to the example I have seen,
except the address for the FAC is @>834A in the E/A manual.

Subj:   RE: backup


I WAS CONSIDERING editing the line to match a 720k disk (>B40 for >2D0 size,
>12 for sectors/track, >0202 for DSDD, and >01 for the first bitmap entry --
but I didn't see that last one.  Sector 1 looks about the same except only
even sectors can be pinters ( >0002, >0004, etc ).  Actually odd pointers are
legal, there is just no routine way to create one since sectors are blocked
two at a time in the bitmap.  This should not be a factor since you are in 
complete control of both reading and writing to these backup files.

I guess even with the bugs I should still be able to see how much compression
occurs in the backup process.  Oh yes don't forget the tracks/side byte for
80 trackers ( >50 for >28 )in sector zero.
